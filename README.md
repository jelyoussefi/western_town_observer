A comprehensive satellite image analysis system for archaeological detection in Madinat Al-Gharbiya, Morocco. This project uses AI and remote sensing techniques optimized for Moroccan archaeological sites, with a focus on Merinid architecture.

## Project Overview

This system integrates multiple remote sensing data sources with specialized AI models to detect, classify, and analyze archaeological features in the Doukkala region of Morocco. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Optimized collection of Sentinel-2, Landsat, and DEM data
2. **AI Processing**: Specialized models for Islamic/Merinid architectural detection
3. **Multi-spectral Analysis**: Custom indices for semi-arid climate archaeological features
4. **Classification**: Typological and chronological analysis of structures
5. **Mapping**: Production of specialized archaeological maps
6. **Field Preparation**: GPS waypoints and excavation planning

## System Requirements

- Docker
- 8GB+ RAM
- 50GB+ disk space
- Internet connection for satellite data download
- Google Earth Engine account (for data acquisition)
